# climate_starter.ipynb
The climate_starter script provides a comprehensive analysis of climate data using Python and SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite). The script focuses on precipitation and temperature observations to explore weather patterns and station activity.
The analysis begins by extracting the most recent date in the dataset, calculating the date one year prior, and querying precipitation data for the past year. The results are stored in a Pandas DataFrame, sorted by date, and visualized using a line plot. Summary statistics of the precipitation data, such as mean, median, and maximum values, are also computed, highlighting key insights into rainfall patterns.
The script then performs an exploratory station analysis, identifying the total number of weather stations and ranking them by activity level based on the number of observations. The most active station is identified (USC00519281), and temperature data from this station is analyzed to compute minimum, maximum, and average temperatures. Additionally, temperature observations for the past year are visualized in a histogram with 12 bins, illustrating the frequency of various temperature ranges.
This well-structured exploration showcases how SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib can be effectively used to analyze and visualize climate data, providing meaningful insights into historical weather trends.

# app.py
The provided app.py script is a Flask application that serves as an API for exploring climate data from a SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite). Using SQLAlchemy for database interactions, the script reflects tables into ORM classes and establishes routes for querying specific climate information.
The root route (/) lists all available endpoints, including routes to access precipitation data, station information, temperature observations, and summary statistics for specific date ranges. The /api/v1.0/precipitation endpoint returns a dictionary of precipitation data for the last year, while /api/v1.0/stations provides a list of all weather stations. The /api/v1.0/tobs endpoint fetches temperature observations for the last year from the most active station.
The application also supports date-based queries. The /api/v1.0/<start> route computes minimum, average, and maximum temperatures from a user-specified start date to the most recent data, while /api/v1.0/<start>/<end> extends this functionality to a specified date range. The results are returned in JSON format, making the API user-friendly and suitable for integration with other applications. This well-structured script demonstrates efficient database querying, data transformation, and API development using Flask.
